/*
Inside the function, the operation 1 << update performs a left shift on the number 1 by update places. 
In binary representation, shifting 1 to the left by any number of places effectively multiplies the original number 
(in this case, 1) by 2 raised to the power of the number of places shifted. 
For example, if update is 3, then 1 << 3 equals 8 because (2^3 = 8).
